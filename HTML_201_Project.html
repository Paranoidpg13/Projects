                Some find Kanye to be an abomination since the outbursts about contemporary times in 
                VMAs and private occupancy of religious minorities within industries. The best feature 
                however relies on his reform to act hospitable when challenged about aforementioned 
                vitriols. Such methodologies dignify the musician and depart from perhaps the fashionable 
                identities for those who seek risks. A basis for how his music continues to cultivate himself
                more than of his other works include "Ghost Town".
